**AutomationScript**

Any activity done over once can be automated. 

Originally developed for a client, the script reduces procedure time from 3 hours per process to seven minutes.

Employing similar automation helps in reducing bottlenecks and improves productivity.

**Features**
- __File Manipulation__: Automates moving and reorganizing files, including unzipping and flattening directories, based on configurable criteria.
- __Report Automation__: Generates reports from data extracted from PDFs that contain tables.
- __Modular Design__: Makes reproducing automation scripts easier, since it uses reusable classes.

**Usage**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Configure the paths and parameters as per your needs in the `config.json`.
4. Modify the main script per your needs and run `main.py` to start the automation process.
